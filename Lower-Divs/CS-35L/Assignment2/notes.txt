1. Result: 141053783706712069063207958086063189881486743514715667838838675999954867742652380114104193329037690251561950568709829327164087724366370087116731268159313652487450652439805877296207297446723295166658228846926807786652870188920867879451478364569313922060370695064736073572378695176473055266826253284886383715072974324463835300053138429460296575143368065570759537328128
   Command used: (* (expt 2 (- 607 1)) (- (expt 2 607) 1))

2. Command used: (+ (floor (+ (log (expt 2 (- 607 1)) 2) (log (- (expt 2 607) 1) 2))) 1)
   and the result I got was 1214

3. C-h k is the keybinding for the describe-key command. So by doing C-h k C-h k it will display
   information about what that key sequence does. In this case it describes what the describe-key command does.

4. Similarly, C-h k M-SPC will display information that describes what the keybinding does, 
   which runs the cycle-spacing command.

5. The general M-SPC function is the cycle-spacing funtion. There are 3 different ways to execute the function. 
   First way is to use the keybinding for the function M-SPC while on the buffer. Second is to use M-: (cycle-spacing). 
   Third way is to use M-x cycle-spacing.

6. When I run shuf.py on Python 2 it ran into errors. Python 2 and 3 are very distinct.
   One of the errors I encountered was with f-strings which are not supported in Python 2.
   Other sources of error were with file handling and argparse behavior.
