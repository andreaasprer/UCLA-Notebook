Since were looking at Git v2.39, I decided to only look at commits during this version so I ran,

  git checkout v2.39.0

Now I want to look for commits that includes the string we are looking for with:

  git log --grep='In read-only repositories'

which gave two commits with the ids:
  bcf22f29df87f25582de0ac9274d1567fa16be6f
  19118cb8570e499e1a56e81740cee3d1c1206b44
so from these commits, there were messages about mergin the branch 'js/merge-ort-in-read-only-repo'. So let's look at where the merge happens.

  git show 92481d1b26

This outputted a commit message saying they fixed the segfault so let's go to previous commits.

  git show 92481d1b26^

So in this commit, whos author is Johannes Schindelin, this is where it fixes the segmentation fault in real-only repositories.
The output of running this with relavant information is as follows: 

  """
  Author: Johannes Schindelin <Johannes.Schindelin@gmx.de>
  Date:   Wed Sep 28 07:29:21 2022 +0000

    merge-ort: fix segmentation fault in read-only repositories

Then further down the output, the actual fix was to change static void into static int and having a default return.
