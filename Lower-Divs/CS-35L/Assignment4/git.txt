When running the command git branch -va on the two repos these were my outputs:

Git's Repository:
* master                0394451348 The eleventh batch
  remotes/origin/HEAD   -> origin/master
  remotes/origin/jch    515fd3a3b8 Merge branch 'bc/ancient-ci' into jch

Eggert's Repository:
  maint                 f93ff170b9 Git 2.48.1
* master                388218fac7 The ninth batch

  remotes/origin/todo   15c6383f80 What's cooking (2025/02 #03)

There are a few differences, it seems that Eggert's is not up to date and has different commit id's hence the different messages.
Also there is an additional branch called maint that Git's repository doesnt have.
