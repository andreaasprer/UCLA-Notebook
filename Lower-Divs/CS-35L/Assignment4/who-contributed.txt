1. git grep "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

    Searches through the repo for where the string is. Amd shows that it is in the northamerica file.

2. git blame northamerica | grep "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

    However this did not give me the right information because it is not the initial commit where the string we are searching for was first introduced.

3. git log -S "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

    This gave me better information, this is the output:
        commit c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b
        Author: Arthur David Olson <ado@elsie>
        Date:   Thu Dec 21 11:43:42 1995 -0500

            Eggert changes
            
            SCCS-file: northamerica
            SCCS-SID: 7.20

    From the output, I learned the commit that introduced the line. So I looked into the commit with

4. git blame c12b432741eed9a422fbf99fa27af6e7a941d88b northamerica | grep "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

    This command gave me this output
        c12b43274 (Arthur David Olson 1995-12-21 11:43:42 -0500  285) # and writes ``Even newspaper reports present contradictory information.''

    So in this commit the original author is Arthur David Olson from 1995 with the commit id: c12b43274

    However, I want to see what Prof. Eggert changed to this line so I ran the command:

5. git blame northamerica | grep "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

    This gave me the commit id c8f960ec7 which showed that Eggert modified the line. 

6. git show c8f960ec7 | git grep "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

    I ran this command to see the specifics of what Prof. Eggert changed which is:
    northamerica:# and wrote "Even newspaper reports present contradictory information."

    From the information I gathered, it seemed all that Prof. Eggert did was change writes to wrote.
